				The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/us/gunman-who-shot-giffords-to-be-sentenced.html?hp" target="_blank">court proceedings on November 8, 2011</a>, in Tucson, Arizona held lots of emotion as multiple victims testified in front of Jared Loughner, the young man who had wounded them and killed their loved ones. 
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
				“You tried to create for all of us a world as dark and evil as your own,” Mark Kelly, former U.S. House of Representatives member Gabby Gifford’s husband said. “But know this and remember it always: You failed.”
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
				The now 35-year old Jared Loughner was sentenced to seven life terms in federal prison, without parole, for killing six and wounding 13 in a shooting at a constituents meeting lot held by former U.S. Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in January 2011. Giffords was shot in the head and critically injured, but has since recovered.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			These testimonies prompted lots of conversation about underlying mental health issues, as well as people’s ignorance to those struggling and the government’s need to address gun control in our nation.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Mass shootings have been a prevalent part of U.S. culture since the 80s and 90s. Lots of different things factor into a mass shooting taking place, and recent data from Mother Jones offers insights into these events.

			<h3 style="font-family: Merriweather;">Almost Half of The Mass Shooters Showed Signs of Mental Health Issues Before The Attack 
			</h3>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Mother Jones, a nonprofit publication, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/#criteria" target="_blank">analyzed 149 mass shootings in the U.S. from 1982-2023</a> to grapple insights into these happenings. 72 mass shooting perpetrators had shown indicators of mental health struggles before carrying out their attack. Interestingly, for 60 of the instigators, it is unknown, or still being determined, whether or not they exhibited signs of mental health issues before the shooting. The 149 mass shootings are instances where four or more victims were killed (not including the perpetrator) in a single location, however, due to a 2013 federal mandate from former President Obama, they have since included attacks where three or more people were killed.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			According to the data from Mother Jones, multiple of the attackers had been dealing with mental conditions such as schizophrenia and depression, while others exhibited erratic and bizarre behavior. Some perpetrators had vocalized or written about a desire to kill (either oneself or other people, or both), while some had not shown or spoken anything about killing. Even for some cases where it wasn’t clear whether or not the individual showed signs of mental illness before the attack, there were sometimes indications of troubling behavior, or prior struggles with alcohol and/or drug abuse.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Professor Newman, the Director of the Ph.D. Program in Social Psychology at Syracuse University, specifically focuses on how people perceive and come to conclusions relating to events such as mass shootings. That can also include inaccurate correlations when it comes to mental health issues and violence.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			“The vast majority of people with mental illness never engage in violent behavior and the vast majority of gun deaths have nothing to do with mental illness,” said Professor Newman in an interview.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			When it comes to examining the role of mental health in mass shootings, Mother Jones has not made it clear how they define someone who has shown mental health issues prior to the shooting. Whether they were definitely diagnosed or not is unknown.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			“There are plenty of people with mental health issues who don’t interface with the mental health system,” said Professor Newman.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Dr. Ragy Girgis is an associate professor of clinical psychiatry in the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry and the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Dr. Girgis told <a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/mass-shootings-and-mental-illness" target="_blank">Columbia Psychiatry News</a> in an interview that “serious mental illness—specifically psychosis—is not a key factor in most mass shootings or other types of mass murders.”
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			He continued: “Other risk factors, such as a history of legal problems, challenges coping with severe and acute life stressors, and the epidemic of the combination of nihilism, emptiness, anger, and a desire for notoriety among young men, seem a more useful focus for prevention and policy than an emphasis on serious mental illness, which leads to public fear and stigmatization.”

			<h3 style="font-family: Merriweather;">More Weapons Were Obtained Legally Than Illegally 
			</h3>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			According to this data, it’s about six times more likely that the weapons in U.S. mass shootings from 1982-2023 were purchased legally than illegally. Americans have long shown concern over gun laws in the U.S., especially in light of these mass shootings. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s-gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/" target="_blank">2021 study from Pew Research Center</a> has shown that a little over half of Americans (53%) believe that gun laws should be stricter than they currently are. Additionally, almost half of Americans (49%) believe that there would be fewer mass shootings if it was more difficult to legally purchase guns, according to this Pew Research Center study.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Further look at the data from Mother Jones also shows that about three-quarters of the mass shootings from 1982-2023 included high-capacity magazines, which hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, and/or semi-automatic weapons.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Interestingly enough, the Pew Research Center study states that almost two-thirds of Americans (64%) support a ban on high-capacity magazines and assault-style weapons.

			<h3 style="font-family: Merriweather;">The Future of Mass Shootings in The U.S.</h3>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Mother Jones only records mass shootings through December 6, 2023, these trends or findings can't necessarily be applied to mass shootings from this year. So far, it’s not clear exactly how many mass shootings have occurred this year in the U.S., and if those same factors from previous years would perform the same way now.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: Inter;">
			Another interesting finding is that Mother Jones doesn't include shootings where the attacker wasn’t identified, or where the attacker took their own life. Therefore, it’s possible that they could be lacking multiple data points there. Attacks that stem from domestic violence intentions or “motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence” aren’t included in this dataset. Mother Jones has mentioned in <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/#criteria" target="_blank">“A Guide to Mass Shootings”</a> that this is a more conservative measure of the problem. However, Mother Jones has also admitted that their “investigation provides an in-depth look at a distinct phenomenon”, and that theirs is the “most useful approach” for investigating this issue.
